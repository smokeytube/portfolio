			<h1>What I learned in the App Development Unit</h1>

            <p>In the app design unit I learned a little bit of javascript. I specifically learned anonymous functions,
            callback functions, and how to style elements. I also learned how similar
            app design and web design are. I learned that apps also use wireframes.</p>

            <p>I learned that there are a lot of companies that make websites and apps for other companies.</p>
