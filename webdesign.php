			<h1>What I learned</h1>

            <p>In the webdesign unit I learned various HTML tags, like h1-h6, a, p, img, and others.
            I learned how to use wireframes to scope out websites I want to build.
            I also learned how to make my websites better and more colorful with CSS.</p>

            appriciation of the internet now that I know how complicated it is.</p>
